Write as a pseudocode an algorithm to calcuate the factorial of a number using a function called fact() 
which takes as an input number and returns the factorial of that number.

FUNCTION Fact(num: INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
    DECLARE index : INTEGER
    DECLARE Factorial : INTEGER
    Factorial <- 1
    FOR index <- 1 TO num
        Factorial <- Factorial * index
    NEXT index
    RETURN Factorial
ENDFUNCTION

OUTPUT "enter num:"
INPUT Number
TempFact <- Fact(Number)
OUTPUT "The factorial is", TempFact
